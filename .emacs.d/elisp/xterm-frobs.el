;;; Commentary:

;; Commands for tty-mode emacs when running under xterm, to manipulate the
;; parent xterm state.  Some of these commands may only work with post-1996
;; XFree86 xterm versions.

;; Color defaults and algorithms derived from the xterm-189 (2004-5-16)
;; distribution from http://dickey.his.com/xterm/
;; In particular see XTerm-col.ad and 256colres.pl
;; These values may differ from those of earlier releases of xterm.

;; Updates of xterm-frobs.el may be retrieved via
;; http://www.splode.com/~friedman/software/emacs-lisp/

;;; Code:

;; If emacs is running under the `screen' tty session management program
;; (which does its own terminal emulation), the sequence sent to the
;; terminal must be wrapped in a Device Control String so that the original
;; control sequence will be passed uninterpreted to the parent xterm.
